# Paul Trip Landing Page Test

### 1.0.0

Initial page pass complete with responsiveness. This was a coding test given by a client who supplied the text and images. Design was left to me.
Completion time was about 4 hours.

### Versioning
We will be utilizing a three-point numbering system.
- Point 1 (1.#.#) is used for site launches, phases, and site redesigns.
- Point 2 (#.1.#) is used for major edits, such as the finalizing of new templates, adding new sections or modules, etc.
- Point 3 (#.#.1) is used for minor structure/style/script edits, such as SDS edits, bug fixes, etc.
Each point can go past a single digit of iterations (for instance, the 11th major edit without a site launch would be 0.11.0, and not 1.1.0).

### Emojis
Here's a list of useful emojis for tracking changes (stripped from [Atom's commit messages](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages)):
- :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
- :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
- :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
- :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
