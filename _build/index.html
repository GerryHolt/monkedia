            <h2>Faith: What Are You Hoping For?</h2>

            <h4>What is faith?</h4>

            <img src="../ui/images/faith.png" align="right" width="35%" />
            <p>
                We all know that the Bible defines faith as "the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen" - but do we know how to live by faith in the street-level situations and relationships of our daily Christianity?
            </p>

            <p>
                Join pastor and best-selling author Paul David Tripp on a powerful 9 session journey through Hebrews 11 to discover how to live a hope-filled life of faith in Jesus Christ.
            </p>

            <p>
                This video series also includes a study guide, filled with helpful application questions, to assist you, your small group, or your church bring faith to life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using Hebrews 11 as a guide, Paul Tripp will contend that there are no heroes of faith in the Bible. Noah, Abraham, Moses and the others enshrined were weak and messy Christians just like us, who often felt that the call of God was too big for them.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>You will also discover:</strong>
